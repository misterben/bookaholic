A Chrome extension for search different bookstores

My original bookmarklet is in bookmarklet.js

I started with a bookmarklet that would simply change an amazon.com url to amazon.co.uk. From there I added a change from .co.uk to the second-hand book website alibris.co.uk

The idea is to collect these into a Chrome extension instead, and make it easily extensible so that people could add their own favourite book vendors with a simple addition of the ISBN search url, and a function that would return the ISBN from a page of the given site.
